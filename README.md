This is second homework for course of Principles, Practices, and Patterns of Software Design. 

The programm is a game with simple rules:
  * There is a word and you know a number of letters;
  * You have 5 attempts to guess it;
  * Every step you should type one letter;
  * If this letter is in the word, it will be shown;
  * If not, you will lose one attempt;
At the end of game (no matter you will gueess the word or you will loose) you will be shown the initial word
